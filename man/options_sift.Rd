\title{Set and get options related to how \code{\link[=sift]{sift()}} runs.}
\usage{
options_sift(
  key = c("sift_limit", "sift_guessmax", "sift_peeklength"),
  val = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{key}{(String) The name of an option.}

\item{val}{(Optional) A new value for the option, if you want to change it.}
}
\value{
The option's value. If invoked with no arguments (\code{options_sift()}),
prints the status of all options to the console and returns \code{NULL}.
}
\description{
\itemize{
\item \code{sift_limit} (Integer; default \code{25})
\itemize{
\item How many matches should \code{\link[=sift]{sift()}} print? This saves you from locking up R
by accidentally printing a summary that is thousands of columns long.
}
\item \code{sift_guessmax} (Integer; default \code{1000})
\itemize{
\item Running summary statistics on very large dataframes (hundreds of columns,
millions of rows) can take a long time. This option controls the point at
which \code{\link[=sift]{sift()}} decides that a dataframe has too many rows to use as-is,
and starts randomly sampling from it instead.
\item For any dataframe with \code{nrow() <= guessmax}, the entirety
of each column will be used for summary stats like "Missing \%" and "Peek
at unique values". Above this row count, \code{n = guessmax} elements of each
column will be randomly sampled without replacement to make these stats,
and a warning glyph will be shown alongside those stats to show that they
were estimated.
\item Factor variables are never sampled; their levels are used in full.
}
\item \code{sift_peeklength} (Integer; default \code{3000})
\itemize{
\item When \code{\link[=sift]{sift()}} creates a dictionary, it generates a "peek" that previews
the unique values of each column. You are only shown a small part of that
peek in query results, but the full peek is used to search through the
dictionary. This option controls how long (in characters) this full peek
is allowed to be. The practical maximum is around 30 thousand characters.
The default of 3000 characters is about as long as a 1-page Word document
at default settings.
